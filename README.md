## description

    
This is a Node.js application that allows a user to create a team by prompting a series of questions and storing the employee information. The employee information is then written to a file in HTML format that shows the structure of the team.

The code requires the following packages: inquirer, fs, and util to handle user inputs and file management. Additionally, it requires four custom modules: Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager which provide the functionality for creating employee objects with specific attributes.

The user is prompted with questions to input information about the employee, including their name, id, email, and role. Based on the role selected, additional questions are asked to gather more specific information. The process can be repeated to add multiple employees to the team.

Once the user has entered all desired employees, the team is displayed in an HTML file using the information entered and stored in a cardArr array.

In addition the application uses jest and 4 test suites to test the functionality of the classes as well as their class functions
